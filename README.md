# Image Segmentation

This is a self undertaken project to do image segmentation on Webcam data using Kmeans++.

### Dependencies :
      1. OpenCV
      2. NumPy
      3. Matplotlib
      4. SKLearn
      
      
Here, KMeans++ was used for segmetation, which is provided by SKLearn Library.


## Results :

<div><h3>Original Image :</h3></div>

<br>
<div><h3>Final Image : (12 dominant colors)</h3></div>

Go on then, clone it/ fork it and create your own segmented image (My github profile pic is this specific image) :p
